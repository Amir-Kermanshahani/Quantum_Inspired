Randomized Singular Value Decomposition is a modification of SVD that is applied to high dimensional data in a matrix A where we thinks there is a low-rank structure between its rows and columns that we can mine out and reduce the dimensions of the matrix.

The technique is based on the emerging techniques in randomized linear algebra, high-dimensional geometry and random matrix theory.
