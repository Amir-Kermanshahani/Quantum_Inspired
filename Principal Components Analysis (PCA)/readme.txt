Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD for short) to compute the Principal Components Analysis (PCA for short).

PCA is one of the most important techniques in the statistical analysis of high dimensional data.

Using these techniques, you can find the dominant directions of variants in the data. 

We create a dataset that is a large Gaussian cloud of points that is moved away from the origin, stretched out in one direction and compressed in the other and finally rotated.
