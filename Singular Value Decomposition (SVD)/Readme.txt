Singular Value Decomposition or SVD for short, is one of the techniques to reduce the dimensions of an input matrix.

Using this technique, the input matrix A is decomposed to the multiplication of 3 other matrices : A = U * S(Sigma) * VT(V Transpose)

To have a better result for the decomposition, we use an SVD technique that truncates the output matrix to the extent of desired rank r.

In This example, SVD is used to reduce the dimentionality of input images down to the desired rank r.
